Hello, I am [vrk](https://github.com/vrk/) and as of Aug 14, 2017 I cannot use a [curling iron](https://www.target.com/p/conair-174-ceramic-satin-finish-instant-heat-curling-iron-1-1-2/-/A-10538613#lnk=sametab).

This is a blog documenting my journey as I attempt to learn to use a curling iron. If I'm successful, I'm going to make the most comprehensive (and comprehensible) curling iron tutorial in history.

### WHAT IS THIS

So when I was a younger vrk, I was pretty nerdy (hard to believe, I know) and didn't really do anything with hair, clothes or makeup. I found makeup and clothes were pretty easy to catch up on in later years, but hair??? fuuuuuuuu.

Makeup requires money and painting skills; clothes requires money and a vision. But hair??? Hair requires like... hand-eye cordination. The ability to contort your arms in weird ways around your head. It is basically a sport, and I am terrible at sports.

Anyway, my hair stylist recently gave me a hair cut that requires styling to look right.

I was like
> "Ahhh D: but I am terrible with a curling iron!" 

And she was like
> "You're unemployed for 6 weeks! You have nowhere to be. Do your hair every morning till you get it right!"

I mean... *she wasn't wrong*.

I decided I'm giving it a try! I will do my hair every day-ish for the next 6 weeks, and I'm documenting my journey via this blog.

### Theory and approach

I've documented the [details of my hair experiment](approach), including overall strategy, routine, and exact products used. Feedback welcome!

### Curling I can do

Do not confuse my inability to use a curling iron with a universal inability to curl, as I am reasonably proficient in the following:

- [Curling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMz_XwbJ8l8)
- [`curl`ing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL)
